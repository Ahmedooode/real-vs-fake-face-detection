## üìÑ Abstract

This project presents the design and implementation of an **attendance system** that detects **real vs fake faces** using **computer vision** and **deep neural networks**.  
Traditional attendance methods can be easily manipulated by photos, videos, or masks ‚Äî leading to security breaches.  
By leveraging **YOLOv8**, **Face Mesh (MediaPipe)**, and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** accelerated by **CUDA GPU processing**, the system achieves **high accuracy** in real-time antispoofing detection.

It provides:

- Accurate real-time identification.
- A graphical user interface (GUI) for login and attendance.
- A practical solution for **educational institutions** and secure facilities.

## üéØ Objectives

- Develop a neural network capable of distinguishing **real** and **fake** faces in real time.
- Improve accuracy under variable lighting and facial angles.
- Integrate the system into a **smart attendance platform** using YOLOv8 + CNN.
- Prevent spoofing via printed images, video replays, and 3D masks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

1. **Face Feature Extraction:**  
   Using MediaPipe‚Äôs **Face Mesh**, 468 3D facial landmarks (x, y, z) were extracted.
2. **Model Training:**
   - Model: YOLOv8-Large (Ultralytics)
   - Framework: PyTorch
   - Training: GPU-accelerated (NVIDIA GTX 1050 Ti, CUDA 12)
3. **Offline Training:**  
   Dataset split into train/test with labeled classes (`real`, `fake`).
4. **Evaluation:**  
   Used **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, **accuracy**, and **confusion matrix**.
5. **Integration:**  
   Combined with a **face recognition system** and **attendance database (SQLite3)** for real-world usage.
